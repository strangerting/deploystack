Changes:

* Monitoring:
    * Both UptimeRobot and StatusCake improved their paid SMS credits offers (UptimeRobot doubled the amount of SMS and StatusCake halved their prices)
    * Added information about status pages (free for UptimeRobot and paid for StatusCake)
* Hosting:
    * Updated pricing for DigitalOcean, Linode. They all offer more resources - like more RAM or disk space for the same price (and some of the changes are quite impressive - DigitalOcean doubled the amount of RAM in each plan)
    * Added GCE to the free tier of hosting. They offer a small f1-micro machine for free forever (at least until they will suddenly decide to change the pricing, like they did for google maps) - it's more than enough to run a website with a small traffic (I have moved the deploystack.io from AWS to this and it works perfectly fine)
    * Amazon Lightsail offers now a $3.5 plan with 512 MB of RAM, 1 CPU, 20 GB SSD and 1 TB of transfer
    * For $15 DigitalOcean offers 3 different configurations (3 GB RAM and 1 CPU / 2 GB RAM and 2 CPUs / 1 GB RAM and 3 CPUs), which can give you some nice flexibility - if you are running one of those configurations and you notice that you are not using much of the CPU but a lot of the RAM, you can very easily switch the instance to a more suitable configuration (here is how: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/how-to/migrate-droplets)
* Domains:
    * Namecheap has slightly increased prices of their domains (from $0.50 for the most popular domain up to $2 for less popular ones)
    * Namecheap and Namesilo are currently running sales on many of their domains where the first time registration of a domain is cheaper ( around $2 cheaper for the most popular domains like .com, .org, but even up to $30 cheaper for domains like .pizza), which is a pretty nice deal if you are thinking about buying a domain.
* Files storage
    * AWS S3 glacier storage is now cheaper (around $0.004-0.005 per GB/month, comparing to $0.007-0.012 that was before).
* CDN:
    * AWS Cloudfront now has 132 Points of Presence (up from 87)
    * MaxCDN has been acquired by StackPath and since I couldn't find a good replacement for it, I have limited the "Monthly plans" section to only CloudFlare. While reviewing the available CDN services, I have extended the "Pay as you go" to also include the KeyCDN (that has a slightly cheaper prices than CDN77 and requires lower yearly recharge than CDN77)
